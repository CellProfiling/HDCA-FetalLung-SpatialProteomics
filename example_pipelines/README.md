# HDCA-FetalLung-SpatialProteomics Example Pipelines
This folder contains example jupyther notbeooks showcasing the analysis pipelines for spatial proteomics data from fetal lung tissue as described in [this preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.25.577163). The data analyzed in the example notebooks has been published on zenodo under [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.11623167.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11623167) (Direct link to zenodo archive: https://zenodo.org/records/11623167).
