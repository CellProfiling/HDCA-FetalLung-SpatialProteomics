# HDCA-FetalLung-SpatialProteomics
Custom software written for analysis of spatial proteomics data from fetal lung acquired in the [Human Developmental Cell Atlas project](https://hdca-sweden.scilifelab.se/). 
The [example_pipelines folder](https://github.com/CellProfiling/HDCA-FetalLung-SpatialProteomics/tree/main/example_pipelines) contains example python code applied to analyze the single-cell data derived from pipex analysis of spatial proteomics images.
The [ImageJ_Macro folder](https://github.com/CellProfiling/HDCA-FetalLung-SpatialProteomics/tree/main/ImageJ_Macro) contains the imagej macro that was used in the preprint for a pipex-independent analysis of marker expression in artery-close immune cells.
